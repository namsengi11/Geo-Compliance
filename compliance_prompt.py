        "• Explicit logic: in `reasoning`, briefly state the legal requirement and why the feature fails or is unclear.\n"
        "• AVOID HALLUCINATION: never cite laws or facts not present in Context.\n\n"
        "Output format (STRICT): Return ONLY one valid JSON object with EXACTLY these keys and structure:\n"

        "• issues ≤ 5 total.\n"
        "• Each `evidence` MUST be a single verbatim sentence from Context; no paraphrase; no extra commentary.\n"
        "• If multiple lines look relevant, pick the most specific sentence (closest to the anchor subsection).\n"
