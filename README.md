# Geo-Compliance

sample input through CLI:
```bash
python main.py "To comply with the Utah Social Media Regulation Act, we are implementing a curfew-based login restriction for users under 18. The system uses ASL to detect minor accounts and routes enforcement through GH to apply only within Utah boundaries. The feature activates during restricted night hours and logs activity using EchoTrace for auditability. This allows parental control to be enacted without user-facing alerts, operating in ShadowMode during initial rollout." -k 5
